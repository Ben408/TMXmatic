A prototype for LLM Translation with quality assurance.

Step 1:
An XLIFF file is submitted for processing

Step 2:
The XLIFF file is processed locally using the Google Translation LLM
https://huggingface.co/google/translategemma-12b-it/tree/main

Step 3:
Results from the LLM are checked using UQLM
https://github.com/cvs-health/uqlm?tab=readme-ov-file

Step 4:
Translation Quality is evaluated for accuracy, fluency and correct Tone of Voice.

Step 5:
The XLIFF file target TU is updated with the best result from the LLM + QA process
The metadata inside the TU is modified with the translated by LLM as well as the quality information.
